To use this skeleton, first clone it from github and then: 

1. Change the placeholder `PKG` to your package name everywhere it appears. 

   The command `grep -rin "PKG" . && find . -name "*PKG*"` should not find anything.

2. Update the text in the `DESCRIPTION` and `R/PKG-package.R` files.

3. Set up Travis and CodeCov

4. Delete these instructions and begin working on your package!
